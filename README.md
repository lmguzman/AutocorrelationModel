AutocorrelationModel
====================

Model for temporal autocorrelation on community predators. 

This model is an extension of the model on the effect of temporal autocorrelation on a network of sink populations by Roy et al 2005. 
It includes any number of predatos that live of the prey that are also migrating between populations.
It uses a discrete time Nicholson and Bayley model.
